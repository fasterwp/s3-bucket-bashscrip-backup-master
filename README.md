# S3 Bucket automated Backup

We all have come to the point when we need to decide what to do about backing up a website. There are many solutions out there.Â 
I had the necessity to backup many websites and have also a quick way to manage it across many instances of Wordpress. I am going to share with you my solution and I would really appreciate your feedback about it.

## Getting Started

SSH into your Linux instance (ubuntu in my case) and clone the repo in the backup folder. 
Create the folder /home/ubuntu/backup/repo/ folder

### Prerequisites

There are not specific requirement. Just maske sure you are running the last updated version of Ubuntu.


### Installing

Clone the repo then add the cronjob by 

```
crontab -e
```

then add the cronjob, in my case I am exectuting a backup at midnight:

```
0 0 * * * /home/ubuntu/backup/backup.sh "/home/ubuntu/backup/repo" "your-s3-backup-folder" "your-wordpress-document-root-absolute-path" "your-db-name" > /home/ubuntu/backup/backup.log
```

This will enable an automated backup every midnight.

## The Bash Script is explained in the following medium article:
